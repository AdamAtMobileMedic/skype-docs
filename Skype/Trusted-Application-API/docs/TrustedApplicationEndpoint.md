# Set up a Trusted Application Endpoint 

Tenant Admin Provisioning includes both setting up the **trusted endpoints** and **tenant admin consent**. This article will   help you set up  the **Trusted Application Endpoints**. 
Please refer [Tenant Admin Consent](./TenantAdminConsent.md) for a tenant to consent to the application.

You can easily register **Trusted Application Endpoints** by using the PowerShell cmdlets.
General information about PowerShell cmdlets usage can be found in [Using Windows PowerShell to manage Skype for Business Online](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362831.aspx). 

## Prerequisite

1. [Download and install the Skype for Business Online Connector module](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688)

2. Please make sure that the execution policy of PowerShell is not set to **Restricted**. Open Windows PowerShell and run **Get-ExecutionPolicy** cmdlet to get the current execution policy. Please read [Execution Policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) page to set appropriate PowerShell policies. 

## Managing Trusted Application Endpoint With PowerShell

1. Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator and run the following:

```PowerShell
Import-PSSession (New-CsOnlineSession -Credential Get-Credential)
```
2. You will be prompted with a windows PowerShell credential dialog box. Sign in using the tenant credentials. 

Successful completion of the above mentioned steps will create a Windows PowerShell session that makes a connection to the Skype for Business Online. Now you can use PowerShell cmdlets to set up the application endpoint.

## PowerShell cmdlets to setup Trusted Application Endpoint

```PowerShell
Set-CsOnlineApplicationEndpoint -PhoneNumber +14256160796
  ```
