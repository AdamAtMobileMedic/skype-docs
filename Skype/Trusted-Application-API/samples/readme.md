# Trusted Application API samples

To jump start developement with the Trusted Application API, we've created the following sample applications that you can clone or download from our **GitHub** OfficeDev organization.

## QuickStart application sample

The [Quick start console application](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs/tree/live/Skype/Trusted-Application-API/samples/QuickStartSamples) can be considered a "100 level" sample. It shows you how to make the minimum usable calls against the Trusted Application API. There are only
five steps to deploy this application.  Be sure to get familiar with this sample and deploy it before you tackle the next sample.  

## Azure web application samples

The [Trusted Application - Azure web app samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs/tree/live/Skype/Trusted-Application-API/samples/AzureWebSamples) are other "100 level" samples that can be deployed to a cloud such as Azure to run simple Trusted Application scenarios.

## Anonymous meeting join application sample

This [sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs/tree/live/Skype/Trusted-Application-API/samples/AnonMeetingJoinSamples) can actually be deployed on in a cloud such as Azure and it will let you complete a simple online meeting join scenario. It requires that you
spend a little bit more time in Azure application registration so that you can set up needed Azure resources.
